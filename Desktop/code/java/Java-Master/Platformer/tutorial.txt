Introduction:
This is an adventure game, when you collect enough
gold coins you can move on to the next level.

Keys explained:
left key-move left
right key-move right
down key- move down
space - jump
Q key - dig
W key - use trampoline to jump
1 key - pick trampoline
2 key - place trampoline

Items explained:
1. Hammer: With hammer, you could dig(sounds wierd, I know) dirt blocks(brown) 
and gold blocks(yellow), but you cannot dig iron blocks(grey). The hammer will 
be destroyed after digging three dirt blocks (of course if you want to dig gold 
blocks your hammer will be destroyed faster), you must go get a new hammer in order 
to continue digging.
2. Trampoline: The height that your player can jump is limited, so you need to jump 
to a higher platform with the help of trampoline. You can take the trampoline to the 
position you want. But please note that you can't pick the hammer when you are carrying 
the trampoline.
3. Monster: The monster will only move within a specific range and you will get hurt 
if you run into it (I know it's not that easy to get hurt by him).

After you collect 50 coins, a wormhole will appear and carries you to the next level.
